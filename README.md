Cyber Security Internship Projects at SkillCraft Technology
This repository contains a collection of cybersecurity projects focusing on encryption, image processing, and password security.

Task 1: Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

A Python program that encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm:

Encryption: Shifts letters by a specified key value.
Decryption: Restores the original text using the same key.
File Handling: Reads and writes messages to/from files.

Task 2: Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

A tool for encrypting and decrypting images using pixel manipulation techniques:

Encryption: Alters pixels using pixel swapping and mathematical operations.
Decryption: Restores images using the reverse of the encryption method.

Task 3: Password Complexity Checker Tool

A Python tool that checks the strength of passwords based on:

Length Check
Uppercase, Lowercase, Digit, and Special Character Check
Password Strength Classification: Strong, Good, or Weak.
